	<h1>ABOUT ME.</h1>
	<p> I am shy, but I am really fun to be around. I have a good sense of humor.  I'm ecletic, and sometimes people do not get me at first.  I love loose leaf green tea - I drink it daily!  I'm a foodie that is slowing transitioning into a health nut.  Oh ... and I will eventually get a chocolate lab and a toy poodle.</p>

	<h1>MY STOMPING GROUND.</h1>
	<p>I am orginally from Northern California (Bay Area), and now living in Atlanta (talk about a culture shock!)  I've held many jobs, have studied at a few colleges, and always have had a keen eye for design.  But, I never thought about pursuing my career in this field until I began my studies at SCAD (Savannah College of Art and Design).  I finally realized that this is my calling.  Now I'm a Thinkful student studying Front-End Development because I want the best of both worlds by learning the technical side, and bring my design background to create functional responsive websitse and apps that are pleasing to the eye -- and will catch your attention.</p>

	<h1>MORE STUFF ABOUT ME.</h1>
	<p>Family, education and good health is extremely important to me.  My family is what keeps me grounded.  Education is one of the most powerful tools that no one cannot take from you.  And when I'm good health - I feel better.</p>
	<h2>What are you favorite hobbies?</h2>
	<p>I enjoy photography - particularly black & white, cooking and sketching.</p>
	<h2>What is your dream job?</h2>
	<p>I would love to turn my design and technical experience into my own interactive branding studio.  That would be awesome!</p>
	<h2>What music do you listen to when you're in your creative zone?</h2>
	<p>Frank Ocean, Outkast, Smashing Pumpkins, Prince, and the list goes on.</p>
